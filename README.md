# MyriadMobile
Once upon a time, a brave hero could simply go to a town center to discover a list of quests with which to feed himself. Unfortunately, as with all things, as the world becomes more complicated, the life of a hero becomes more difficult and busy. Today, it is a heroic quest to simply even find the town center. We have been tasked with simplifying this process.
As a potential Mobile Master, your duty is to construct a solution for this terrible injustice in the form of a 21st century Quest-Board. Here, damsels in distress, kings under siege, and townsfolk threatened by dangerous beasts will make their quests available to all the great heroes of the world. By connecting heroes with quest-givers, you will not only improve the lives of citizens in our great kingdom, but also the lives of heroes whom we rely upon.
